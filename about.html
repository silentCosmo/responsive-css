        <h1 class="about-headline">The SETI Institute</h1>
        <p class="about-para">is a non-profit research organization, located in the Silicon Valley close to the NASA Ames Research Center.
        Our mission is to lead humanity's quest to understand the origins and prevalence of life and intelligence in the
        universe and share that knowledge with the world.</p>

                <p>The Institute began small, with just one project – NASA’s SETI program – and two employees, founder Tom Pierson (a
                former grants administrator at San Francisco State University), and astronomer Jill Tarter. Over the years, other
                research disciplines have been added to the Institute’s portfolio, all unified by their relevance to the search for, and
                understanding of, life beyond Earth. Today, the Institute has approximately 100 scientists as well as specialists in
                administration, education, and outreach.

                <h2>Carl Sagan Center</h2>
                <p>The Carl Sagan Center for Research is home to more than 100 scientists, a tally that is steadily growing. These
                researchers have expertise in nearly all branches of science relevant to the development of life, where it might exist,
                and how we can find it.</p>

                <h2>Center for Education</h2>
                <p>The fundamental questions being addressed by SETI Institute researchers have great popular appeal. They are therefore
                excellent “hooks” to interest young people in STEAM topics, subject matter that is at the core of our formal education
                programs. The Center for Education promotes STEAM education through NASA- and NSF-funded programs aimed at teaching and
                inspiring children, young adults and educators with an emphasis on space sciences and astrobiology.</p>

                <h2>Center for Outreach</h2>
                <p>Science is not just for scientists. We want to share the excitement of our research, but also promote greater science
                literacy in general. Efforts include more than a hundred or more popular lectures given annually, programs at museums
                and planetariums, and numerous popular articles in magazine, newspapers, and on the web. Regular outreach offerings
                include SETI Talks, our monthly lecture series, the weekly Big Picture Science podcast and radio program, SETI Live
                talks on social media, Journey e-newsletter and Explorer magazine.</p>
